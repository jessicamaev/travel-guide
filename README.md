# 🗺️ About The Project 

Develop a <b>full-stack app that uses the Python-based Django Web Framework</b> with a team of two. 

Your App Must:

* Be a full-stack Django application.
* Have at least one data entity (Model) in addition to the built-in User model.
* Connect to and perform data operations on a PostreSQL database (the default SQLLite3 database is not acceptable).
* Have at least 3 of the 4 CRUD data operations across any combination of the app's models (excluding the User model). For example, creating/reading posts and creating/deleting comments qualifies as 3 of 4 CRUD operations.
* Authenticate users using Django's built-in authentication.
* Implement authorization by restricting access to the Creation, Updating & Deletion of resources using the login_required decorator in the case of view functions; or, in the case of class-based views, inheriting from the LoginRequiredMixin.
* Be deployed online using Heroku. Presentations must use the deployed application.

The app may optionally:
* Consume data from a third-party API.
* Upload images/assets to AWS S3.
